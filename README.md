A CNN model that can classify X-Ray images as a <b>Tuberculosis case or a Normal case</b>.

# Website
[Website](https://ajas-classifier.herokuapp.com/) <br>


# Dataset
This model is developed with the help of dataset from Kaggle.
Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset) to go to the Kaggle Dataset. 



# Motivation
In this century where everything is at our fingertips, why wait in a long queue to get your X-rays scanned by a radiologist? Especially to find out if you or your loved ones are affected by a serious disease like Tuberculosis? Not anymore, weâ€™ve developed a system that brings radiologists to your fingertips!

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/jith4j/Tuberculosis-Classification.git```


# Contribute

This project is made only to classify if an X-ray is having Tuberculosis or not. As a next step, the model could be further developed to classify if an X-ray image is having any other disease also.
